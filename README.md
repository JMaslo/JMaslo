### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸ“š | Basic information
  Hello, my name is VojtÄ›ch and I'm junior Python Developer. 
  
  I am interested in Python because it's in my opinion the easiest way how to get into coding.
  
  I have started programming about 2 years ago, last year my passion to coding grew even bigger.
  
## ðŸ’» | Coding experience
  
  At the beginning of my programming career I started learning HTML/CSS.
  
  After a few weeks/months I skipped to Java -> Minecraft Developer but I found that for the beginning it's not the best to start with so i figured that I will start with Python
