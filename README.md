### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸ“š | Basic information

  Hello, my name is VojtÄ›ch and I'm junior Python Developer.
  
  I am interested in Python because it's in my opinion the easiest way how to get into coding.

  I have started programming about 2 years ago, last year my passion to coding grew even bigger.

## ðŸ’» | Coding experience

  At the beginning of my programming career I started learning HTML/CSS.

  After a while I have figured out that HTML/CSS just isn't for me, so I went and tried to do few projects in Java as Minecraft (plugin) developer, but I   consider Java only as a hobby, so now my full focus is on Python.
